# 🔥 Firestore Security Rules Setup

## Production-Ready Security Rules

### Quick Setup Instructions:

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   - Navigate to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your project: `seo-automation-cd33b`

2. **Open Firestore Database:**
   - Click on "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
   - Click on the "Rules" tab

3. **Replace Current Rules:**
   - Copy the rules from `firestore.rules` file
   - Paste them into the Firebase Console rules editor
   - Click "Publish"

### 🔒 Security Features:

✅ **User Isolation** - Users can only access their own data
✅ **Email Validation** - Email format is validated
✅ **Immutable Fields** - Critical fields like `uid`, `email`, `createdAt` cannot be changed
✅ **No Deletion** - User documents cannot be deleted (disable in Firebase Auth instead)
✅ **Authenticated Only** - All operations require authentication
✅ **Data Validation** - Ensures proper data structure on create/update

### 📋 Rules Summary:

```
Users Collection (/users/{userId}):
- READ: ✅ Only the user themselves
- CREATE: ✅ Only once during signup, with validation
- UPDATE: ✅ Only the user themselves, limited fields
- DELETE: ❌ Not allowed

Projects Collection (/projects/{projectId}):
- READ/WRITE: ✅ Only if userId matches authenticated user

Analytics Collection (/analytics/{docId}):
- READ: ✅ Only if userId matches authenticated user
- WRITE: ❌ Backend only

Everything Else:
- READ/WRITE: ❌ Denied by default
```

### 🛡️ Production Best Practices:

1. ✅ Never use test mode in production
2. ✅ Always validate data types and formats
3. ✅ Limit field updates to prevent data corruption
4. ✅ Use helper functions for reusable logic
5. ✅ Default deny all, explicitly allow what's needed
6. ✅ Validate user ownership on all operations

### 🧪 Testing Your Rules:

In Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules → Rules Playground:

**Test Read (Should Pass):**
```
Authenticated: Yes
Auth UID: user123
Location: /users/user123
Read: ALLOW ✅
```

**Test Read Other User (Should Fail):**
```
Authenticated: Yes
Auth UID: user123
Location: /users/user456
Read: DENY ❌
```

### ⚠️ Important Notes:

- These rules are **production-ready** and secure
- Users can only access their own data
- Sensitive operations are restricted
- Data integrity is enforced
- If you need to modify user data from backend, use Firebase Admin SDK

### 🔄 Updating Rules:

You can also update rules using Firebase CLI:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```
